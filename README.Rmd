`SummArIzeR` is an R
package, that allows an
easy use of EnrichR to
compare enrichment
results from multiple
databases of multiple
conditons. It results in
a clustering of enriched
terms and enables the
annotation of these
terms by creating a
promt for large language
models such as gpt4.
Results can be
vizualised in a Heatmap.

## Example

This is a basic example
which shows you how to
run SummArIzeR. We
create an example
dataframe from two
celltypes comparing a
disease and control
group:

```{r, example}
library(SummArIzeR)
library(enrichR)
library(factoextra)

set.seed(1234)

genelist_df <- data.frame(
  genes = c(
    "IL6", "IFNG", "IL10", "TNF", "CXCL8", "STAT3", "STAT1", "JAK1", "JAK2", "SOCS1", 
    "SOCS3", "IL1B", "IL18", "IL12A", "IL23A", "GATA3", "RORC", "CCR7", "CXCR3", "CCL2",

  ),
  Group = c(

    "Disease", "Disease", "Control", "Disease", "Disease", "Control", "Disease", "Control", "Disease", "Disease",

  ),
  CellType = c(

    "CD4", "Monocytes", "Monocytes", "CD4", "CD4", "CD4", "CD4", "CD4", "CD4", "Monocytes",

  log2fold = c(1.65922417, 1.74830165, -0.85544186, 1.32179050, 0.56698208, 0.07638380, 0.94635326, -1.46133361, 0.62796916, 0.82025914, -0.16903290, 0.87644901, 1.73868899, -0.97828470, -0.15082871, 1.76005809, 1.91290571, -1.53005055, -0.10001167, 0.24133098, 1.61612555, -1.44515933, 1.95556692, 1.78667293, -1.67024977, 0.05684714, -0.43918613, 1.62295252, -0.21212149, 1.34401704, 0.95038247, 1.24422057, -0.44756687, 0.74067892, -1.98420664, 1.33166432, -1.97066341, -1.16936411, 1.62640563, 0.44711457, -0.48176304, -0.25691366, -1.85027587, 1.89415966, -0.27299500, 1.83030639, 1.55101962, 0.55991508, 1.88386644)
)
```

We can perform the
enrichment analysis for
the different conditions
CellType and Group: Here
we extract the top 5
hits from every database
and every condition. The
input is data.frame with
gene-level data. Must
include a "genes"
column, conditions
column, and, optionally,
"log2fold" if splitting
by regulation. If
split_by_reg (default =
FALSE) is set to TRUE,
enrichment is performed
separately on up- and
down-regulated genes.
The logFC_threshold
(default = 0) parameter
defines the log
fold-change cutoff used
to define up/down
regulation when
split_by_reg = TRUE. The
adjusted p-value cutoff
is used to filter
significant enriched
terms. The parameter n
(default = 10) shwos the
number of top enriched
terms to return per
condition and per
category, whereas the
min_genes_threshold
(default = 3) is the
minimum number of genes
required to consider a
term in downstream
analysis. The enrichment
categories can be chosen
from the set of
libraries available in
[EnrichR](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/#libraries):

```{r, enrichment, include=T, eval = FALSE}
Termlist_all<-extractMultipleTerms(genelist_df, condition_col = c("CellType", "Group"), categories = c("GO_Biological_Process_2023","Reactome_2022", "BioPlanet_2019"), pval_threshold = 0.05, n = 5, split_by_reg = T)

```

```{r, view, include=T}
head(Termlist_all, n = 5)

```

Edges below the
similarity treshold (ts)
are deleted. The optimal
treshold can be
validated by checking
the number of clusters,
the connected terms and
the modularity. The
threshold value
determins which edges
between terms (nodes)
are retained in the
network (those with a
distance weight higher
than ts). Smaller values
include more edges;
larger values result in
sparser graphs:

```{r, evaluate_cluster, include=T, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
evaluateThreshold(Termlist_all)
```

The network can be
interactively
visualized, and if
needed, the threshold
can be readjusted.

```{r, cluster_network, include=T, fig.width=15, fig.height=12}
plot<-TRUplotIgraph(Termlist_all, ts  = 0.3)
#htmltools::tagList(plot)
```

```{r, plot_network, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}

plot
```
After treshold
adjustment, clusters can
be assigned to the
dataframe and the Prompt
can be generated:

```{r, prompt, include=T,}
Genelist_test_cluster<-returnIgraphCluster(Termlist_all, ts = 0.3)
head(Genelist_test_cluster, n = 5)
generateGPTPrompt(Genelist_test_cluster)
```

The prompt can be
queried using a LLM like
ChatGPT. The result can
be copied into R. Now, a
final data frame
containing the cluster
annotations can be
created:

```{r cluster_annotation, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#Enter vector from LLM 
cluster_summary <- c(
  '1' = 'T Cell Transcriptional Regulation',
  '2' = 'Interleukin Signaling Pathways',
  '3' = 'Inflammatory Response Activation',
  '4' = 'STAT and IL-17 Pathway Regulation',
  '5' = 'Cytokine-Mediated Immune Signaling',
  '6' = 'T Cell Proliferation and Inflammatory Regulation',
  '7' = 'IL-20 Family Signaling',
  '8' = 'Cytokine Response',
  '9' = 'Type II Interferon Response',
  '10' = 'Antiviral Cellular Response',
  '11' = 'Chemokine Signaling',
  '12' = 'Negative Regulation of Organismal Processes',
  '13' = 'Th17 Cell Differentiation',
  '14' = 'Th1/Th2 Cell Differentiation'
)



print(cluster_summary)

```

The clusters can now be
annotated based on the
vectors defined above.
Here, one could specify
different methods for
pooling p-values
resulting from multiple
terms. In addition, this
pooled p-value is capped
at a min_pval (default =
1e-10), making it better
suitable for plotting.
However, users can
select a lower min_pval
threshold.

```{r, annotation}
Annotation_list<- annotateClusters(Genelist_test_cluster, cluster_summary)
```

The results can be
plotted as a Bubbleplot.
If the enrichment was
done for up-and
downregulation
seperatly, the plot will
be split for up-and
downregulated genes.

```{r, Bubbleplot,  fig.width=8.27, fig.height=7}

plotBubbleplot(Annotation_list)

```

Additionally, the
results can be plotted
as a Heatmap. If the
enrichment was done for
up-and downregulation
seperatly, the Heatmap
can be split for up-and
downregulated genes. The
heatmap can be further
customized by setting
cluster_rows/columns to
TRUE.

```{r, Heatmap,  fig.width=8.27, fig.height=7}

#plotHeatmap(Annotation_list, rot = 90, annotation_bar = F, column_names_centered = F)

```
