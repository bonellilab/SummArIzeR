`SummArIzeR` is an R package, that allows an easy use of EnrichR to
compare enrichment results from multiple databases of multiple
conditons. It results in a clustering of enriched terms and enables the
annotation of these terms by creating a promt for large language models
such as gpt4. Results can be vizualised in a Heatmap.

## Features

- Perform enrichment analysis using `enrichR`.
- Allows analysis of multiple conditions
- Analyze up- and down-regulated genes separately.
- Filter terms by p-value and gene thresholds.
- Calculates similarities of results terms based on included genes
- Clusters terms using random walk algorithm
- Generates a prompt for a LLM to summarized cluster annotations
- Allows easy heatmap visualization
